                      It was my junior year at a large state university and I lived on campus in sort of what was known as the, like, the party dorm. I was clearly a bad fit for it. I’d lived there for three years. And while I was there, a sort of subtle kind of harassment started, which involved me being gay. And at the time, I was not out to myself or out to anyone else. It originally started just as whispers and then became very aggressive.
                      So if I went into the bathroom, someone would say, “Don’t go in there. The fag’s in there.” Or if I went into the shower, somebody would be, you know, be sure not to go in the shower. “You don’t know what will happen.”
                      And I was spending a lot of time with a friend of mine, who – another man – who, I’m sure, you know, we were in love with each other, but neither one of us were out. And he was manic depressive. We were spending a lot of time together and he was going through a breakdown. Because we spend so much time together, the guys on my hall assumed all sorts of things about why we would be spending so much time together in my room, when basically I was trying to take care of him...
