@HackRice 2020 First-timer track

### Mission Statement: Free mentoring & education platform for LGBTQ+ teenagers

Why EMBRACE?
LGBTQ teenagers may experience high levels of anxiety at home, at school, in social circles and communities. Often, they cannot get enough help and support from the people around them. 
Embrace connects these teenagers to qualified mentors from our partner LGBTQ organizations. After each teenager gets paired up with a mentor, they will be able to express their feelings and get advice from someone who is experienced and empathetic. 
So, if you ever need help, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. We are here to EMBRACE you!
